# Simple Test Server

This utility is used to create and provide test data. This uses [a JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and [a faker](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, change into the projects directory and run 

```
npm install
```

To generate test data use

```
npm run make
```

To run the simple REST server use 

```
npm run serve
```


To change the number of rows being generated, edit `config.json`
